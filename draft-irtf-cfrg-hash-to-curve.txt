1.  Introduction

   Many cryptographic protocols require a procedure that encodes an
   arbitrary input, e.g., a password, to a point on an elliptic curve.
   This procedure is known as hashing to an elliptic curve.  Prominent
   examples of cryptosystems that hash to elliptic curves include Simple
   Password Exponential Key Exchange [J96], Password Authenticated Key
   Exchange [BMP00], Identity-Based Encryption [BF01] and Boneh-Lynn-
   Shacham signatures [BLS01].

   Unfortunately for implementors, the precise hash function that is
   suitable for a given scheme is not necessarily included in the
   description of the protocol.  Compounding this problem is the need to
   pick a suitable curve for the specific protocol.

   This document aims to bridge this gap by providing a thorough set of
   recommended algorithms for a range of curve types.  Each algorithm
   conforms to a common interface: it takes as input an arbitrary-length
   bit string and produces as output a point on an elliptic curve.  We
   provide implementation details for each algorithm, describe the
   security rationale behind each recommendation, and give guidance for
   elliptic curves that are not explicitly covered.

2.  Background

2.1.  Elliptic curves

   The following is a brief definition of elliptic curves, with an
   emphasis on important parameters and their relation to hashing to
   curves.  For further reference on elliptic curves, consult
   [CFADLNV05] or [W08].

   Let F be the finite field GF(q) of prime characteristic p.  In most
   cases F is a prime field, so q = p.  Otherwise, F is a field
   extension, so q = p^m for an integer m > 1.  This document assumes
   that elements of field extensions are written in a primitive element
   or polynomial basis, i.e., as of m elements of GF(p) written in
   ascending order by degree.  For example, if q = p^2 and the primitive
   element basis is {1, i}, then the vector (a, b) corresponds to the
   element a + b * i.

   An elliptic curve E is specified by an equation in two variables and
   a finite field F.  An elliptic curve equation takes one of several
   standard forms, including (but not limited to) Weierstrass,
   Montgomery, and Edwards.

   The curve E induces an algebraic group whose elements are those
   points with coordinates (x, y) satisfying the curve equation, and
   where x and y are elements of F.  This group has order n, meaning
   that there are n distinct points.  This document uses additive
   notation for the elliptic curve group operation.

   For security reasons, groups of prime order MUST be used.  Elliptic
   curves induce subgroups of prime order.  Let G be a subgroup of the
   curve of prime order r, where n = h * r.  In this equation, h is an
   integer called the cofactor.  An algorithm that takes as input an
   arbitrary point on the curve E and produces as output a point in the
   subgroup G of E is said to "clear the cofactor."  Such algorithms are
   discussed in Section 7.

   Certain hash-to-curve algorithms restrict the form of the curve
   equation, the characteristic of the field, and/or the parameters of
   the curve.  For each algorithm presented, this document lists the
   relevant restrictions.

2.2.  Terminology

   In this section, we define important terms used in the rest of this
   document.

2.2.1.  Mappings

   A mapping is a deterministic function from an element of the field F
   to a point on an elliptic curve E defined over F.

   In general, the set of all points that a mapping can produce over all
   possible inputs may be only a subset of the points on an elliptic
   curve (i.e., the mapping may not be surjective).  In addition, a
   mapping may output the same point for two or more distinct inputs
   (i.e., the mapping may not be injective).  For example, consider a
   mapping from F to an elliptic curve having n points: if the number of
   elements of F is not equal to n, then this mapping cannot be
   bijective (i.e., both injective and surjective) since it is defined
   to be deterministic.

   Mappings may also be invertible, meaning that there is an efficient
   algorithm that, for any point P output by the mapping, outputs an x
   in F such that applying the mapping to x outputs P.  Some of the
   mappings given in Section 6 are invertible, but this document does
   not discuss inversion algorithms.

2.2.2.  Encodings

   Encodings are closely related to mappings.  Like a mapping, an
   encoding is a function that outputs a point on an elliptic curve.  In
   contrast to a mapping, however, the input to an encoding is an
   arbitrary bit string.  Encodings can be deterministic or
   probabilistic.  Deterministic encodings are preferred for security,
   because probabilistic ones can leak information through side
   channels.

   This document constructs deterministic encodings by composing a hash
   function H with a deterministic mapping.  In particular, H takes as
   input an arbitrary bit string and outputs an element of F.  The
   deterministic mapping takes that element as input and outputs a point
   on an elliptic curve E defined over F.  Since the hash function H
   takes arbitrary bit strings as inputs, it cannot be injective: the
   set of inputs is larger than the set of outputs, so there must be
   distinct inputs that give the same output (i.e., there must be
   collisions).  Thus, any encoding built from H is also not injective.

   Like mappings, encodings may be invertible, meaning that there is an
   efficient algorithm that, for any point P output by the encoding,
   outputs a bit string s such that applying the encoding to s outputs
   P.  The hash function used by all encodings specified in this
   document (Section 5) is not invertible; thus, the encodings are also
   not invertible.

2.2.3.  Random oracle encodings

   Two different types of encodings are possible: nonuniform encodings,
   whose output distribution is not uniformly random, and random oracle
   encodings, whose output distribution is indistinguishable from
   uniformly random.  Some protocols require a random oracle for
   security, while others can be securely instantiated with a nonuniform
   encoding.  When the required encoding is not clear, applications
   SHOULD use a random oracle.

   Care is required when constructing a random oracle from a mapping
   function.  A simple but insecure approach is to use the output of a
   cryptographically secure hash function H as the input to the mapping.
   Because in general the mapping is not surjective, the output of this
   construction is distinguishable from uniformly random, i.e., it does
   not behave like a random oracle.

   Brier et al.  [BCIMRT10] describe two generic constructions whose
   outputs are indistinguishable from a random oracle.  Farashahi et al.
   [FFSTV13] and Tibouchi and Kim [TK17] refine the analysis of one of
   these constructions.  That construction is described in Section 3.

2.2.4.  Serialization

   A procedure related to encoding is the conversion of an elliptic
   curve point to a bit string.  This is called serialization, and is
   typically used for compactly storing or transmitting points.  For
   example, [SECG1] gives a standard method for serializing points.  The
   reverse operation, deserialization, converts a bit string to an
   elliptic curve point.

   Deserialization is different from encoding in that only certain
   strings (namely, those output by the serialization procedure) can be
   deserialized.  In contrast, this document is concerned with encodings
   from arbitrary bit strings to elliptic curve points.  This document
   does not cover serialization or deserialization.

2.2.5.  Domain separation

   Cryptographic protocols that use random oracles are often analyzed
   under the assumption that random oracles answer only queries
   generated by that protocol.  In practice, this assumption does not
   hold if two protocols query the same random oracle.  Concretely,
   consider protocols P1 and P2 that query random oracle R: if P1 and P2
   both query R on the same value x, the security analysis of one or
   both protocols may be invalidated.

   A common approach to addressing this issue is called domain
   separation, which allows a single random oracle to simulate multiple,
   independent oracles.  This is effected by ensuring that each
   simulated oracle sees queries that are distinct from those seen by
   all other simulated oracles.  For example, to simulate two oracles R1
   and R2 given a single oracle R, one might define

   R1(x) := R("R1" || x)
   R2(x) := R("R2" || x)

   In this example, "R1" and "R2" are called domain separation tags;
   they ensure that queries to R1 and R2 cannot result in identical
   queries to R.  Thus, it is safe to treat R1 and R2 as independent
   oracles.

3.  Roadmap

   This section presents a general framework for encoding bit strings to
   points on an elliptic curve.  To construct these encodings, we rely
   on three basic functions:

Internet-Draft                hash-to-curve                    July 2019


   o  The function hash_to_base, {0, 1}^* -> F, hashes arbitrary-length
      bit strings to elements of a finite field; its implementation is
      defined in Section 5.

   o  The function map_to_curve, F -> E, calculates a point on the
      elliptic curve E from an element of the finite field F over which
      E is defined.  Section 6 describes mappings for a range of curve
      families.

   o  The function clear_cofactor, E -> G, sends any point on the curve
      E to the subgroup G of E.  Section 7 describes methods to perform
      this operation.

   We describe two high-level encoding functions (Section 2.2.2).
   Although these functions have the same interface, the distributions
   of their outputs are different.

   o  Nonuniform encoding (encode_to_curve).  This function encodes bit
      strings to points in G.  The distribution of the output is not
      uniformly random in G.

   encode_to_curve(alpha)

   Input: alpha, an arbitrary-length bit string.
   Output: P, a point in G.

   Steps:
   1. u = hash_to_base(alpha, 2)
   2. Q = map_to_curve(u)
   3. P = clear_cofactor(Q)
   4. return P

   o  Random oracle encoding (hash_to_curve).  This function encodes bit
      strings to points in G.  The distribution of the output is
      indistinguishable from uniformly random in G provided that
      map_to_curve is "well distributed" ([FFSTV13], Def. 1).  All of
      the map_to_curve functions defined in Section 6 meet this
      requirement.

   Input: alpha, an arbitrary-length bit string.
   Output: P, a point in G.

   Steps:
   1. u0 = hash_to_base(alpha, 0)
   2. u1 = hash_to_base(alpha, 1)
   3. Q0 = map_to_curve(u0)
   4. Q1 = map_to_curve(u1)
   5. R = Q0 + Q1
   6. P = clear_cofactor(R)
   7. return P

   Instances of these functions are given in Section 8, which defines a
   list of suites that specify a full set of parameters matching
   elliptic curves and algorithms.

3.1.  Domain separation requirements

   When invoking hash_to_curve from a higher-level protocol,
   implementors MUST use domain separation (Section 2.2.5) to avoid
   interfering with other protocols that also use the hash_to_curve
   functionality.  Protocols that use encode_to_curve SHOULD use domain
   separation if possible, though it is not required in this case.

   Protocols that instantiate multiple, independent random oracles based
   on hash_to_curve MUST enforce domain separation between those
   oracles.  This requirement applies both in the case of multiple
   oracles to the same curve and in the case of multiple oracles to
   different curves.  This is because the hash_to_base primitive
   (Section 5) requires domain separation to guarantee independent
   outputs.

   Care is required when choosing a domain separation tag.  Implementors
   SHOULD observe the following guidelines:

   1.  Tags should be prepended to the value being hashed, as in the
       example in Section 2.2.5.

   2.  Tags should have fixed length, or should be encoded in a way that
       makes the length of a given tag unambiguous.  If a variable-
       length tag is used, it should be prefixed with a fixed-length
       field that encodes the length of the tag.

   3.  Tags should begin with a fixed protocol identification string.
       Ideally, this identification string should be unique to the
       protocol.

   4.  Tags should include a protocol version number.

   5.  For protocols that support multiple ciphersuites, tags should
       include a ciphersuite identifier.

   As an example, consider a fictional key exchange protocol named Quux.
   A reasonable choice of tag is "QUUX-V<xx>-CS<yy>", where <xx> and
   <yy> are two-digit numbers indicating the version and ciphersuite,
   respectively.  Alternatively, if a variable-length ciphersuite string
   must be used, a reasonable choice of tag is "QUUX-V<xx>-
   L<zz>-<csid>", where where <csid> is a the ciphersuite string, and
   <xx> and <zz> are two-digit numbers indicating the version and the
   length of the ciphersuite string, respectively.

   As another example, consider a fictional protocol named Baz that
   requires two independent random oracles, where one oracle outputs
   points on the curve E1 and the other outputs points on the curve E2.
   To ensure that these two random oracles are independent, each one
   must be called with a distinct domain separation tag.  Reasonable
   choices of tags for the E1 and E2 oracles are "BAZ-V<xx>-CS<yy>-E1"
   and "BAZ-V<xx>-CS<yy>-E2", respectively, where <xx> and <yy> are as
   defined above.

4.  Utility Functions

   Algorithms in this document make use of utility functions described
   below.

   o  CMOV(a, b, c): If c == 0, CMOV returns a, otherwise returns b.  To
      prevent against timing attacks, this operation must run in
      constant time without revealing the value of c.  Commonly,
      implementations assume that the selector is c == 1 or c == 0.  In
      this case, given a bit string C, the desired selector c can be
      computed by OR-ing all bits of C together.  The resulting selector
      will be either 0 if all bits of C are zero, or 1 if at least one
      bit of C is 1.

   o  is_square(x, q): This function returns True whenever the value x
      is a square in GF(q).  Due to Euler's criterion, this function can
      be calculated in constant time as

   is_square(x, q) := { True,  if x^((q - 1) / 2) is 0 or 1;
                      { False, otherwise.

   o  sqrt(x, q): The sqrt operation is a multi-valued function, i.e.
      there exist two roots of x whenever x is square.  To maintain
      compatibility across implementations while allowing implementors
      leeway for optimizations, this document does not require sqrt() to

      return a particular value.  Instead, as explained in Section 6.3,
      any higher-level function that computes square roots also
      specifies how to determine the sign of the result.

      The preferred way of computing square roots is to fix a
      deterministic algorithm particular to q.  We give algorithms for
      the three most common cases immediately below; other cases are
      analogous.

      Note that Case 3 below applies to GF(p^2) when p = 3 mod 8.
      [AR13] and [S85] describe methods that work for other field
      extensions.  Regardless of the method chosen, the sqrt function
      MUST be performed in constant time.

   o  sgn0(x): This function returns either +1 or -1, indicating the
      sign of x.  This function considers 0 to be positive.  The
      following procedure implements sgn0(x) in constant time.  See
      Section 2.1 for a discussion of representing x as a vector.

   sgn0(x)

   Parameters:
     1. F, a finite field of characteristic p and order q = p^m, m >= 1.
   Input: x, an element of F.
   Output: -1 or 1.

   Notation: x_i is the i^th element of the vector representation of x.

   Steps:
   1. sign = 0
   2. for i in (m, m - 1, ..., 1):
   3.   sign_i = CMOV(1, -1, x_i > (p - 1) / 2)
   4.   sign_i = CMOV(sign_i, 0, x_i == 0)
   5.   sign = CMOV(sign, sign_i, sign == 0)
   6. return CMOV(sign, 1, sign == 0)    # regard x = 0 as positive

   o  inv0(x, q): This function returns the multiplicative inverse of x
      mod q, extended to all of F by fixing inv0(0) == 0.  To implement
      inv0 in constant time, compute alpha = x^(q - 2) mod q.  Notice on
      input 0, the output is 0 as required.

   o  I2OSP and OS2IP: These functions are used to convert an octet
      string to and from a non-negative integer as described in
      [RFC8017].

   o  a || b: denotes the concatenation of bit strings a and b.

5.  Hashing to a Finite Field

   The hash_to_base(msg) function hashes a string msg of any length into
   an element of a field F.  This function is parametrized by the field
   F (Section 2.1) and by H, a cryptographic hash function that outputs
   b bits.

5.1.  Security considerations

   For security, hash_to_base should be collision resistant and its
   output distribution should be uniform over F.  To this end,
   hash_to_base requires a cryptographic hash function H which satisfies
   the following properties:





Faz-Hernandez, et al.    Expires January 5, 2020               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                hash-to-curve                    July 2019


   1.  The number of bits output by H should be b >= 2 * k for
       sufficient collision resistance, where k is the target security
       level in bits.  (This is needed for a birthday bound of
       approximately 2^(-k).)

   2.  H is modeled as a random oracle, so its output must be
       indistinguishable from a uniformly random bit string.

   For example, for 128-bit security, b >= 256 bits; in this case,
   SHA256 would be an appropriate choice for H.

   Ensuring that the hash_to_base output is a uniform random element of
   F requires care, even when H outputs a uniformly random string.  For
   example, if H is SHA256 and F is a field of characteristic p = 2^255
   - 19, then the result of reducing H(msg) (a 256-bit integer) modulo p
   is slightly more likely to be in [0, 38] than if the value were
   selected uniformly at random.  In this example the bias is
   negligible, but in general it can be significant.

   To control bias, the input msg should be hashed to an integer
   comprising at least ceil(log2(p)) + k bits; reducing this integer
   modulo p gives bias at most 2^-k, which is a safe choice for a
   cryptosystem with k-bit security.  To obtain such an integer, hash H
   with b-bit output should be evaluated W = ceil((ceil(log2(p)) + k) /
   b) times and the results concatenated to produce a (W * b)-bit
   integer.  For example, for H = SHA256, k = 128-bit security, and p a
   256-bit prime, W = ceil((256 + 128) / 256) = 2.

   Section 5.3 details the hash_to_base procedure.

   Note that implementors SHOULD NOT use rejection sampling to generate
   a uniformly random element of F.  The reason is that these procedures
   are difficult to implement in constant time, and later well-meaning
   "optimizations" may silently render an implementation non-constant-
   time.

5.2.  Performance considerations

   Since hash_to_base may invoke H multiple times (Section 5.1), its
   performance may be limited by the length of the input msg.  To
   address this, hash_to_base first computes H(msg) and then derives the
   required bits from this value via further invocations of H.  For
   short messages this entails one extra invocation of H, which is a
   negligible overhead in the context of hashing to elliptic curves.

   A related issue is that the random oracle construction of
   Section 2.2.3 requires evaluating two independent hash functions H0
   and H1 on msg.  A standard way to instantiate independent hashes is



Faz-Hernandez, et al.    Expires January 5, 2020               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                hash-to-curve                    July 2019


   to append a counter to the value being hashed, e.g., H(msg || 0) and
   H(msg || 1).  If msg is long, however, this is either inefficient
   (because it entails hashing msg twice) or requires non-black-box use
   of H (e.g., partial evaluation).

   To sidestep both of these issues, hash_to_base takes a second
   argument, ctr, which it appends to H(msg) rather than to msg.  This
   means that two invocations of hash_to_base on the same msg with
   different ctr values both start by computing the value H(msg).  This
   is an improvement because it allows sharing one evaluation of H(msg)
   among multiple invocations of hash_to_base, by factoring out the
   common computation.

5.3.  Implementation

   The following procedure implements hash_to_base.

   hash_to_base(msg, ctr)

   Parameters:
   - H, a cryptographic hash function producing b bits.
   - F, a finite field of characteristic p and order q = p^m.
   - W = ceil((ceil(log2(p)) + k) / b), where k is the security
     parameter of the cryptosystem (e.g., k = 128).

   Inputs:
   - msg is the message to hash.
   - ctr is either 0, 1, or 2.
     This is used to efficiently create independent
     instances of hash_to_base (see discussion above).

   Output: u, an element in F.

   Steps:
   1. m' = "HASH-TO-CURVE" || H(msg) || I2OSP(ctr, 1)
   2. for i in (1, ..., m):
   3.   t = ""     // initialize t to the empty string
   4.   for j in (1, ..., W):
   5.     t = t || H( m' || I2OSP(i, 1) || I2OSP(j, 1) )
   6.   e_i = OS2IP(t) mod p
   7. return u = ( e_1, ..., e_m )

6.  Deterministic Mappings

   The mappings in this section are suitable for constructing either
   nonuniform or random oracle encodings using the constructions of
   Section 3.

6.1.  Interface

   The generic interface shared by all mappings in this section is as
   follows:

   (x, y) = map_to_curve(u)

   The input u and outputs x and y are elements of the field F.  The
   coordinates (x, y) specify a point on an elliptic curve defined over
   F.  Note that the point (x, y) is not a uniformly random point.  If
   uniformity is required for security, the random oracle construction
   of Section 3 MUST be used instead.

6.2.  Notation

   As a rough style guide the following convention is used:

   o  All arithmetic operations are performed over a field F, unless
      explicitly stated otherwise.

   o  u: the input to the mapping function.  This is an element of F
      produced by the hash_to_base function.

   o  (x, y): are the affine coordinates of the point output by the
      mapping.  Indexed values are used when the algorithm calculates
      some candidate values.

   o  t1, t2, ...: are reusable temporary variables.  For notable
      variables, distinct names are used easing the debugging process
      when correlating with test vectors.

   o  c1, c2, ...: are constant values, which can be computed in
      advance.

6.3.  Sign of the resulting point

   In general, elliptic curves have equations of the form y^2 = g(x).
   Most of the mappings in this section first identify an x such that
   g(x) is square, then take a square root to find y.  Since there are
   two square roots when g(x) != 0, this results in an ambiguity
   regarding the sign of y.

   To resolve this ambiguity, the mappings in this section specify the
   sign of the y-coordinate in terms of the input to the mapping
   function.  Two main reasons support this approach.  First, this
   covers elliptic curves over any field in a uniform way, and second,
   it gives implementors leeway to optimize their square-root
   implementations.

6.4.  Exceptional cases

   Mappings may have have exceptional cases, i.e., inputs u on which the
   mapping is undefined.  These cases must be handled carefully,
   especially for constant-time implementations.

   For each mapping in this section, we discuss the exceptional cases
   and show how to handle them in constant time.  Note that all
   implementations SHOULD use inv0 (Section 4) to compute multiplicative
   inverses, to avoid exceptional cases that result from attempting to
   compute the inverse of 0.

6.5.  Mappings for Weierstrass curves

   The following mappings apply to elliptic curves defined by the
   equation E: y^2 = g(x) = x^3 + A * x + B, where 4 * A^3 + 27 * B^2 !=
   0.

6.5.1.  Icart Method

   The function map_to_curve_icart(u) implements the Icart method from
   [Icart09].

   Preconditions: An elliptic curve over F, such that p>3 and q = p^m =
   2 (mod 3), or p = 2 (mod 3) and odd m.

   Constants: A and B, the parameters of the Weierstrass curve.

   Sign of y: this mapping does not compute a square root, so there is
   no ambiguity regarding the sign of y.

   Exceptions: The only exceptional case is u == 0.  Implementations
   must detect this case by testing whether u == 0 and setting u = 1 if
   so.

   Operations:

   1. If u == 0, set u = 1
   2. v = (3 * A - u^4) / (6 * u)
   3. x = (v^2 - B - (u^6 / 27))^((2 * p - 1) / 3) + (u^2 / 3)
   4. y = u * x + v
   5. return (x, y)

 19. return (x, y)

6.5.2.  Simplified Shallue-van de Woestijne-Ulas Method

   The function map_to_curve_simple_swu(u) implements a simplification
   of the Shallue-van de Woestijne-Ulas mapping [U07] described by Brier
   et al.  [BCIMRT10], which they call the "simplified SWU" map.  Wahby
   and Boneh [WB19] generalize this mapping to curves over fields of odd
   characteristic p > 3.

   0.

   Constants:

   o  A and B, the parameters of the Weierstrass curve.

   o  Z, the smallest (in absolute value) non-square in F such that g(B
      / (Z * A)) is square in F, breaking ties by choosing the positive
      value.

   Sign of y: Inputs u and -u give the same x-coordinate.  Thus, we set
   sgn0(y) == sgn0(u).

   Exceptions: The exceptional cases are values of u such that Z^2 * u^4
   + Z * u^2 == 0.  This includes u == 0, and may include other values
   depending on Z.  Implementations must detect this case and set x1 = B
   / (Z * A), which guarantees that g(x1) is square by the condition on
   Z given above.

   Operations:

   1. den = inv0(Z^2 * u^4 + Z * u^2)
   2.  x1 = (-B / A) * (1 + den)
   3.  If den == 0, set x1 = B / (Z * A)
   4. gx1 = x1^3 + A * x1 + B
   5.  x2 = Z * u^2 * x1
   6. gx2 = x2^3 + A * x2 + B
   7.  If gx1 is square, set x = x1 and y = sqrt(gx1)
   8.  If gx2 is square, set x = x2 and y = sqrt(gx2)
   9.  If sgn0(u) != sgn0(y), set y = -y
   10. return (x, y)

6.5.2.1.  Implementation

   The following procedure implements the simplified SWU algorithm in a
   straight-line fashion.  This implementation is optimized for the case
   that q = 3 (mod 4), which applies to P-256.  For discussion of how to
   generalize to q = 1 (mod 4), see [WB19] (Section 4) or the example
   code found at [hash2curve-repo].

6.6.  Mappings for Montgomery curves

   The mapping defined in Section 6.6.1 implements Elligator 2 [BHKL13]
   for curves defined by the Weierstrass equation y^2 = x^3 + A * x^2 +
   B * x, where A * B * (A^2 - 4 * B) != 0 and A^2 - 4 * B is non-square
   in F.

   Such a Weierstrass curve is related to the Montgomery curve B' * y'^2
   = x'^3 + A' * x'^2 + x' by the following change of variables:

   o  A = A' / B'

   o  B = 1 / B'^2

   o  x = x' / B'

   o  y = y' / B'

   The Elligator 2 mapping given below returns a point (x, y) on the
   Weierstrass curve defined above.  This point can be converted to a
   point (x', y') on the original Montgomery curve by computing

   o  x' = B' * x

   o  y' = B' * y

   Note that when B and B' are equal to 1, the above two curve equations
   are identical and no conversion is necessary.  This is the case, for
   example, for Curve25519 and Curve448 [RFC7748].

6.6.1.  Elligator 2 Method

   Preconditions: A Weierstrass curve y^2 = x^3 + A * x^2 + B * x where
   A != 0, B != 0, and A^2 - 4 * B is non-zero and non-square in F.

   Constants:

   o  A and B, the parameters of the curve

   o  Z, the smallest (in absolute value) non-square in F, breaking ties
      by choosing the positive value.

   Sign of y: Inputs u and -u give the same x-coordinate.  Thus, we set
   sgn0(y) == sgn0(u).

   Exceptions: The exceptional case is Z * u^2 == -1, i.e., 1 + Z * u^2
   == 0.  Implementations must detect this case and set x1 = -A.  Note
   that this can only happen when q = 3 (mod 4).

   Operations:

   1.  x1 = -A * inv0(1 + Z * u^2)
   2.  If x1 == 0, set x1 = -A.
   3. gx1 = x1^3 + A * x1^2 + B * x1
   4.  x2 = -x1 - A
   5. gx2 = x2^3 + A * x2^2 + B * x2
   6.  If is_square(gx1), set x = x1 and y = sqrt(gx1)
   7.  If is_square(gx2), set x = x2 and y = sqrt(gx2)
   8.  If sgn0(u) != sgn0(y), set y = -y
   9.  return (x, y)

6.7.  Mappings for Twisted Edwards curves

   Twisted Edwards curves (a class of curves that includes Edwards
   curves) are closely related to Montgomery curves (Section 6.6): every
   twisted Edwards curve is birationally equivalent to a Montgomery
   curve ([BBJLP08], Theorem 3.2).  This equivalence yields an efficient
   way of hashing to a twisted Edwards curve: first, hash to the
   equivalent Montgomery curve, then transform the result into a point
   on the twisted Edwards curve via a rational map.  This method of
   hashing to a twisted Edwards curve thus requires identifying a
   corresponding Montgomery curve and rational map.  We describe how to
   identify such a curve and map immediately below.

6.7.1.  Rational maps from Montgomery to twisted Edwards curves

   There are two ways to identify the correct Montgomery curve and
   rational map for use when hashing to a given twisted Edwards curve.

   When hashing to a standardized twisted Edwards curve for which a
   corresponding Montgomery form and rational map are also standardized,
   the standard Montgomery form and rational map MUST be used to ensure
   compatibility with existing software.  Two such standardized curves
   are the edwards25519 and edwards448 curves, which correspond to the
   Montgomery curves curve25519 and curve448, respectively.  For both of
   these curves, [RFC7748] lists both the Montgomery and twisted Edwards
   forms and gives the corresponding rational maps.

   The rational map for edwards25519 ([RFC7748], Section 4.1) uses the
   constant sqrt_neg_486664 = sqrt(-486664) mod 2^255 - 19.  To ensure
   compatibility, this constant MUST be chosen such that
   sgn0(sqrt_neg_486664) == 1.  Analogous ambiguities in other
   standardized rational maps MUST be resolved in the same way: for any
   constant k whose sign is ambiguous, k MUST be chosen such that
   sgn0(k) == 1.

   The 4-isogeny map from curve448 to edwards448 ([RFC7748],
   Section 4.2) is unambiguous with respect to sign.

   When defining new twisted Edwards curves, a Montgomery equivalent and
   rational map SHOULD be specified, and the sign of the rational map
   SHOULD be stated unambiguously.

   When hashing to a twisted Edwards curve that does not have a
   standardized Montgomery form or rational map, the following procedure
   MUST be used to derive them.  For a twisted Edwards curve given by a
   * x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d * x^2 * y^2, first compute A and B, the
   parameters of the equivalent curve given by y'^2 = x'^3 + A * x'^2 +
   B * x', as follows:

   o  A = (a + d) / 2

   o  B = (a - d)^2 / 16

   Note that the above curve is given in the Weierstrass form required
   by the Elligator 2 mapping.  The rational map from the point (x', y')
   on this Weierstrass curve to the point (x, y) on the twisted Edwards
   curve is given by

   o  x = x' / y'

Internet-Draft                hash-to-curve                    July 2019


   o  y = (B' * x' - 1) / (B' * x' + 1), where B' = 1 / sqrt(B) = 4 / (a
      - d)

   For completeness, we give the inverse map in Appendix B.  Note that
   the inverse map is not used when hashing to a twisted Edwards curve.

   Rational maps may be undefined, for example, when the denominator of
   one of the rational functions is zero.  For example, in the map
   described above, the exceptional cases are y' == 0 or B' * x' == -1.
   Implementations MUST detect exceptional cases and return the value
   (x, y) = (0, 1), which is a valid point on all twisted Edwards curves
   given by the equation above.

   The following straight-line implementation of the above rational map
   handles the exceptional cases.  Implementations of other rational
   maps (e.g., the ones give in [RFC7748]) are analogous.

  rational_map(x', y')
  Input: (x', y'), a point on the curve y'^2 = x'^3 + A * x'^2 + B * x'.
  Output: (x, y), a point on the equivalent twisted Edwards curve.

  1. t1 = y' * B'
  2. t2 = x' + 1
  3. t3 = t1 * t2
  4. t3 = inv0(t3)
  5.  x = t2 * t3
  6.  x = x * x'
  7.  y = x' - 1
  8.  y = y * t3
  9.  y = y * t1
  10. e = y == 0
  11. y = CMOV(y, 1, e)
  12. return (x, y)

6.7.2.  Elligator 2 Method

   Preconditions: A twisted Edwards curve E and an equivalent curve M
   meeting the requirements in Section 6.7.1.

   Helper functions:

   o  map_to_curve_elligator2 is the mapping of Section 6.6.1 to the
      curve M.

   o  rational_map is a function that takes a point (x', y') on M and
      returns a point (x, y) on E, as defined in Section 6.7.1.

   Constants: B, the parameter of the supersingular curve.

6.9.  Mappings for Pairing-Friendly curves

6.9.1.  Shallue-van de Woestijne Method

   Shallue and van de Woestijne [SW06] describe a mapping that applies
   to essentially any elliptic curve.  Fouque and Tibouchi [FT12] give a
   concrete set of parameters for this mapping geared toward Barreto-
   Naehrig pairing-friendly curves [BN05], i.e., curves y^2 = x^3 + B
   over fields of characteristic q = 1 (mod 3).  Wahby and Boneh [WB19]
   suggest a small generalization of the Fouque-Tibouchi parameters that
   results in a uniform method for handling exceptional cases.

   The Shallue-van de Woestijne mapping method covers curves not handled
   by other methods, e.g., SECP256K1 [SEC2].  It also covers pairing-
   friendly curves in the BN [BN05], KSS [KSS08], and BLS [BLS03]
   families.  (Note, however, that the mapping described in
   Section 6.9.2 is faster, when it applies.)

   Preconditions: An elliptic curve y^2 = g(x) = x^3 + B over F such
   that q = 1 (mod 3) and B != 0.

   Constants:

   o  B, the parameter of the Weierstrass curve

   o  Z, the smallest (in absolute value) element of F such that
      g((sqrt(-3 * Z^2) - Z) / 2) is square, breaking ties by choosing
      the positive value.

   Sign of y: Inputs u and -u give the same x-coordinate.  Thus, we set
   sgn0(y) == sgn0(u).

   Exceptions: The exceptional cases for u occur when u^2 * (u^2 + g(Z))
   == 0.  The restriction on Z given above ensures that implementations
   that use inv0 to invert this product are exception free.

   Operations:

   1. t1 = u^2 + g(Z)
   2. t2 = inv0(u^2 * t1)
   3. t3 = u^4 * t2 * sqrt(-3 * Z^2)

6.9.2.  Simplified SWU for Pairing-Friendly Curves

   Wahby and Boneh [WB19] show how to adapt the simplified SWU mapping
   to certain Weierstrass curves having either A = 0 or B = 0, one of
   which is almost always true for pairing-friendly curves.  Note that
   neither case is supported by the mapping of Section 6.5.2.

   This method requires finding another elliptic curve

   E': y^2 = g'(x) = x^3 + A' * x + B'

   that is isogenous to E and has A' != 0 and B' != 0.  (One might do
   this, for example, using [SAGE]; details are beyond the scope of this
   document.)  This isogeny defines a map iso_map(x', y') that takes as
   input a point on E' and produces as output a point on E.

   Once E' and iso_map are identified, this mapping is straightforward:
   on input alpha, first apply the simplified SWU mapping to get a point
   on E', then apply the isogeny map to that point to get a point on E.

   Preconditions: An elliptic curve E' with A' != 0 and B' != 0 that is
   isogenous to the target curve E with isogeny map iso_map(x, y) from
   E' to E.

   Helper functions:

   o  map_to_curve_simple_swu is the mapping of Section 6.5.2 to E'

   o  iso_map is the isogeny map from E' to E

   Sign of y: for this map, the sign is determined by
   map_to_curve_elligator2.  No further sign adjustments are necessary.

   Exceptions: map_to_curve_simple_swu handles its exceptional cases.
   Exceptional cases of iso_map should return the identity point on E.

   Operations:

   1. (x', y') = map_to_curve_simple_swu(u)    // (x', y') is on E'
   2.   (x, y) = iso_map(x', y')               // (x, y) is on E
   3. return (x, y)

   We do not repeat the sample implementation of Section 6.5.2 here.
   See [hash2curve-repo] or [WB19] for details on implementing the
   isogeny map.

7.  Clearing the cofactor

   The mappings of Section 6 always output a point on the elliptic
   curve, i.e., a point in a group of order h * r (Section 2.1).
   Obtaining a point in G may require a final operation commonly called
   "clearing the cofactor," which takes as input any point on the curve.

   This operation can always be implemented as a scalar multiplication
   by h.  For elliptic curves where h = 1, i.e., the curves with a prime
   number of points, no operation is required.  This applies, for
   example, to the NIST curves P-256, P-384, and P-521 [FIPS186-4].

   In some cases, it is possible to clear the cofactor via a faster
   method than scalar multiplication.  For pairing-friendly curves
   having subgroup G2 over an extension field, Scott et al.  [SBCDBK09]
   describe a method for faster cofactor clearing that exploits an
   efficiently-computable endomorphism.  Fuentes-Castaneda et al.
   [FKR11] propose an alternative method that is sometimes more
   efficient.  Budroni and Pintore [BP18] give concrete instantiations
   of these methods for Barreto-Lynn-Scott pairing-friendly curves
   [BLS03].

   Wahby and Boneh ([WB19], Section 5) describe a trick due to Scott for
   faster cofactor clearing on any elliptic curve for which the prime
   factorization of h and the number of points on the curve meet certain
   conditions.

8.  Suites for Hashing

   The following table lists recommended algorithms for different curves
   and encodings.  To select a suitable algorithm, choose the encoding
   associated with the target curve.  For example, Elligator 2 is the
   recommended encoding for Curve25519, whereas simplified SWU is the
   recommended encoding for P-256.  When the hash function is to be used
   in a protocol whose security is proven in the random oracle model,
   applications SHOULD use the Random Oracle construction given in
   Section 3.

   A suite is a bundle of algorithms that provides concrete
   recommendations for hashing bit strings into points of specific
   elliptic curve groups.  Each suite is a tuple (E, H, f, ROM) such
   that

   o  E, is the elliptic curve group.

   o  H, is the cryptographic hash function used by hash_to_base.

   o  f, is an encoding function compatible with E.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

10.  Security Considerations

   Each encoding function accepts arbitrary input and maps it to a
   pseudorandom point on the curve.  Directly evaluating the mappings of
   Section 6 produces an output that is distinguishable from random.
   Section 3 shows how to use these mappings to construct a function
   approximating a random oracle.

   Section 3.1 describes considerations related to domain separation for
   random oracle encodings.

   Section 5 describes considerations for uniformly hashing to field
   elements.

Appendix A.  Related Work

   The problem of mapping arbitrary bit strings to elliptic curve points
   has been the subject of both practical and theoretical research.
   This section briefly describes the background and research results
   that underly the recommendations in this document.  This section is
   provided for informational purposes only.

   A naive but generally insecure method of mapping a string alpha to a
   point on an elliptic curve E having n points is to first fix a point
   P that generates the elliptic curve group, and a hash function Hn
   from bit strings to integers less than n; then compute Hn(alpha) * P,
   where the * operator represents scalar multiplication.  The reason
   this approach is insecure is that the resulting point has a known
   discrete log relationship to P.  Thus, except in cases where this

   method is specified by the protocol, it must not be used; doing so
   risks catastrophic security failures.

   Boneh et al.  [BLS01] describe an encoding method they call
   MapToGroup, which works roughly as follows: first, use the input
   string to initialize a pseudorandom number generator, then use the
   generator to produce a pseudorandom value x in F.  If x is the
   x-coordinate of a point on the elliptic curve, output that point.
   Otherwise, generate a new pseudorandom value x in F and try again.
   Since a random value x in F has probability about 1/2 of
   corresponding to a point on the curve, the expected number of tries
   is just two.  However, the running time of this method depends on the
   input string, which means that it is not safe to use in protocols
   sensitive to timing side channels.

   Schinzel and Skalba [SS04] introduce the first method of constructing
   elliptic curve points deterministically, for a restricted class of
   curves and a very small number of points.  Skalba [S05] generalizes
   this construction to more curves and more points on those curves.
   Shallue and van de Woestijne [SW06] further generalize and simplify
   Skalba's construction, yielding concretely efficient maps to a
   constant fraction of the points on almost any curve.  Ulas [U07]
   describes a simpler version of this map, and Brier et al.  [BCIMRT10]
   give a further simplification, which the authors call the "simplified
   SWU" map.  The simplified map applies only to fields of
   characteristic p = 3 mod 4; Wahby and Boneh [WB19] generalize to
   fields of any characteristic.

   Icart gives another deterministic algorithm which maps to any curve
   over a field of characteristic p = 2 mod 3 [Icart09].  Several
   extensions and generalizations follow this work, including [FSV09],
   [FT10], [KLR10], [F11], and [CK11].

   Following the work of Farashahi [F11], Fouque et al.  [FJT13]
   describe a mapping to curves of characteristic p = 3 mod 4 having a
   number of points divisible by 4.  Bernstein et al.  [BHKL13] optimize
   this mapping and describe a related mapping that they call "Elligator
   2," which applies to any curve over a field of odd characteristic
   having a point of order 2.  This includes Curve25519 and Curve448,
   both of which are CFRG-recommended curves [RFC7748].

   An important caveat regarding all of the above deterministic mapping
   functions is that none of them map to the entire curve, but rather to
   some fraction of the points.  This means that they cannot be used
   directly to construct a random oracle that outputs points on the
   curve.

   Brier et al.  [BCIMRT10] give two solutions to this problem.  The
   first, which Brier et al. prove applies to Icart's method, computes
   f(H0(msg)) + f(H1(msg)) for two distinct hash functions H0 and H1
   from bit strings to F and a mapping f from F to the elliptic curve E.
   The second, which applies to essentially all deterministic mappings
   but is more costly, computes f(H0(msg)) + H2(msg) * P, for P a
   generator of the elliptic curve group and H2 a hash from bit strings
   to integers modulo n, the order of the elliptic curve group.
   Farashahi et al.  [FFSTV13] improve the analysis of the first method,
   showing that it applies to essentially all deterministic mappings.
   Tibouchi and Kim [TK17] further refine the analysis and describe
   additional optimizations.

   Complementary to the problem of mapping from bit strings to elliptic
   curve points, Bernstein et al.  [BHKL13] study the problem of mapping
   from elliptic curve points to uniformly random bit strings, giving
   solutions for a class of curves including Montgomery and twisted
   Edwards curves.  Tibouchi [T14] and Aranha et al.  [AFQTZ14]
   generalize these results.  This document does not deal with this
   complementary problem.

Appendix B.  Rational maps from twisted Edwards to Weierstrass and
             Montgomery curves

   The inverse of the rational map specified in Section 6.7.1, i.e., the
   map from the point (x', y') on the Weierstrass curve y'^2 = x'^3 + A
   * x'^2 + B * x' to the point (x, y) on the twisted Edwards curve a *
   x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d * x^2 * y^2 is given by:

   o  x' = (1 + y) / (B' * (1 - y))

   o  y' = (1 + y) / (B' * x * (1 - y))

   where

   o  A = (a + d) / 2

   o  B = (a - d)^2 / 16

   o  B' = 1 / sqrt(B) = 4 / (a - d)

   This map is undefined when y == 1 or x == 0.  In this case, return
   the point (0, 0).

   It may also be useful to map to a Montgomery curve of the form B' *
   y''^2 = x''^3 + A' * x''^2 + x''.  This curve is equivalent to the
   twisted Edwards curve above via the following rational map
   ([BBJLP08], Theorem 3.2):

   o  A' = 2 * (a + d) / (a - d)

   o  B' = 4 / (a - d)

   o  x'' = (1 + y) / (1 - y)

   o  y'' = (1 + y) / (x * (1 - y))
