    "body": "From what I understand, the isomorphism factor between a Twisted Edwards and Montgomery curve can be derived as `sqrt((A + 2) / (B * a))`, leaving two possible roots (the sign of which ultimately determines the sign of the point's x/v coordinates). In the case of Curve25519/Ed25519, the computation becomes `sqrt(-486664)`. For Elligator 2, the [draft][draft1] [currently says][draft2] to use a root such that `sgn0(sqrt(-486664)) == 1`. This seems to be inconsistent with the Curve25519/EdDSA RFCs as it does not preserve the base point's sign properly.\r\n\r\n[RFC7748] defines the Montgomery form of Curve25519 to have a base point of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nu = 9\r\nv = 14781619447589544791020593568409986887264606134616475288964881837755586237401\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth [RFC7748] and [RFC8032] define the Twisted Edwards form of Curve25519 to have a base point of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nx = 15112221349535400772501151409588531511454012693041857206046113283949847762202\r\ny = 46316835694926478169428394003475163141307993866256225615783033603165251855960\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe two square roots of `-486664` are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+sqrt(-486664) = 6853475219497561581579357271197624642482790079785650197046958215289687604742\r\n-sqrt(-486664) = 51042569399160536130206135233146329284152202253034631822681833788666877215207\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly, neither of the above RFCs explicitly specify which root to use, but when I extract the isomorphism factor by comparing the above base points, I get the negative square root:\r\n\r\n```\r\nv * x / u = 51042569399160536130206135233146329284152202253034631822681833788666877215207\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the specification should require the sign of `sqrt(-486664)` to be `-1`, not `1`.\r\n\r\nIn Sage:\r\n\r\n``` sage\r\nF = GF(2^255 - 19)\r\nu = F(9)\r\nv = F(14781619447589544791020593568409986887264606134616475288964881837755586237401)\r\nx = F(15112221349535400772501151409588531511454012693041857206046113283949847762202)\r\ny = F(46316835694926478169428394003475163141307993866256225615783033603165251855960)\r\nc = sqrt(F(-486664))\r\n\r\nprint(c)\r\nprint(-c)\r\nprint(c != v * x / u)\r\nprint(-c == v * x / u)\r\nprint(c * u / v != x)\r\nprint(-c * u / v == x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n6853475219497561581579357271197624642482790079785650197046958215289687604742\r\n51042569399160536130206135233146329284152202253034631822681833788666877215207\r\nTrue\r\nTrue\r\nTrue\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n[draft1]: https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve/blob/master/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve.md#rational-maps-from-montgomery-to-twisted-edwards-curves-rational-map\r\n[draft2]: https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve/blob/master/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve.md#edwards25519-elligator-2-map-to-edwards25519\r\n[RFC7748]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#section-4.1\r\n[RFC8032]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1"

    "body": "EDIT: Please see [this comment](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve/issues/202#issuecomment-577864753) for a summary of the proposed changes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSorry to reopen this can of worms, but I think there are a couple reasons to worry about the current version of hash-to-base.\r\n\r\n1. @BjoernMHaase points out that, for embedded systems, hashing can be much more expensive than field or curve operations. The reason is, hashing is done on the main (sometimes 8-bit!) processor, whereas field and curve operations use a specialized co-processor. The result is that, in his CPace implementation, he doesn't want to use our version of hash-to-base.\r\n\r\n    It seems reasonable to expect this to be an issue for several classes of hash-to-curve applications. I think we should be responsive to it, and come up with a simplified version of hash-to-base that's safe in this context.\r\n\r\n2. @reyzin points out that in the VRF draft they were very careful to make sure that all invocations of SHA-2 are domain separated, but our use of H in hash-to-base is incompatible with this. In fact, we sat down and talked through it yesterday, and there does not appear to be a safe and cheap way of domain separating uses of H outside of hash-to-base from its uses inside. The only way to do it appears to be to select a random, 32-byte string (e.g., by hashing a domain separation tag) and prepending that value to every use of H outside of hash-to-base.\r\n\r\n    This is really unsatisfying: first, it adds an extra invocation of the compression function, which is bad in resource-constrained contexts (per (1), above). Second, it means that domain separation requirements \"escape\" the hash-to-curve draft, in the sense that implementors need to understand how hash-to-curve uses H in order to safely reuse H in upper-layer protocols---an abstraction violation.\r\n\r\n3. We've heard from several people that they want to use SHA3, and our version of hash-to-base is overdesigned for this purpose. I don't care so much about overdesign in itself---it would be great if we could have a one size fits all version of hash-to-base---but given issues 1 and 2, we have an opportunity to revisit.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a couple proposals to fix this, one based on KMAC (or perhaps SHAKE) and one that's designed to be safe (including in the sense of (2) above) and efficient for Merkle-Damgaard functions (but should also be safe and efficient for SHA-3). For now I'm not proposing a specific course of action, just giving early warning that this is an issue we should think carefully about."

Moreover, if anyone wants to map to such curves, they can just use one of the other maps---SvdW and SWU would both work (the latter via the isogeny trick).\r\n\r\nSo: from my perspective it's better to simplify the document and not include these. Of course, if anyone decides in the future they really want to use these maps, they can grab the text from draft-05 (or the git repo) and easily do so. But my guess is that no one will...\r\n\r\nI know this PR might be controversial, and I'll understand if y'all disagree! :)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nEDIT: this pr is built on #197, so if we decide to merge it we should do so after that one"

I like this approach because it lets us keep talking about equivalent *Montgomery* curves when such curves are standardized (as I mentioned in my post linked above, I think this makes more explicit the kind of reusability we're aiming for).\r\n\r\nIt might be more consistent to always talk about Montgomery or always talk about Weierstrass. We should think about this to try and understand whether this can be made clean and clear; it's not obvious to me right now."

For an extension tower at least, one assumes this can be done recursively.\r\n\r\nAt the very least we should cite the AR-H12 paper when discussing is_square()."

    "body": "This patch does three (roughly) related things:\r\n\r\n1. It defines two variants of sgn0, \"little endian\" (LE) and \"big endian\" (BE).\r\n  - LE is a generalization of IEEE P1363a-2004 Section 5.5.6.1.1, ANSI X9.62-1998, Section 4.2.1, and [SEC 1 Section 2.3.3](https://secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf). (All three of these use the same notion of sign: the value of the least significant bit.)\r\n      \r\n      This is the notion of sign used by most widely-deployed curves. For example, it's the one specified in RFC 8032 (Sections 5.1.3 and 5.2.3) and the one used in TLS (per [RFC 4492, Section 5.1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4492#section-5.1.2)).\r\n\r\n  - BE is equivalent to the method given in IEEE P1363a-2004, Section 5.5.6.1.2.\r\n\r\n      This is the form used by [BLS12-381](https://github.com/zkcrypto/pairing/blob/master/src/bls12_381/README.md), and is the same as what we used to call sgn0.\r\n\r\n2. It adds a sgn0 parameter to each suite that specifies which sgn0 function to use. All suites use sgn0_le except BLS12-381, which corresponds with widely-used notions of sign for each curve.\r\n\r\n3. It clarifies the sqrt functions and gives a constant-time version of Tonelli-Shanks (which works for any p) due to Sean Bowe, Jack Grigg, Eirik Ogilvie-Wigley, and Michael Scott. It also moves these to the appendix, since we treat sqrt as non-normative (in particular, we don't care about how implementors compute the sign)."

    "body": "The next IETF meeting in Singapore happens soon. The cutoff for submitting a new I-D is [November 4th at 23:59 UTC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/106/important-dates/). This issue is to help with triage.\r\n\r\n# High priority\r\n\r\n- [x] Z selection (#159, #171, #172) --- PR is merged (#172)\r\n\r\n- [x] SvdW update (#155, #157, #172) --- PR is merged (#172)\r\n\r\n- [x] Ciphersuite updates (#158) --- PR is merged (#172)\r\n\r\n- [x] sgn0 / sqrt definitions (#144) --- ~~I've got a PR in the wings for this. I'll push it to completion and submit it in the next couple days.~~ PIR is merged (#176)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Coordinate with Ristretto --- can happen before or after. Main goal is to figure out what the right API is, both for Ristretto and for whichever pieces of h2c the Ristretto draft uses.\r\n\r\n- [x] Coordinate with VRF --- I've opened a pull request (fcelda/nsec5-draft#35) against VRF for this. Probably safe to assume we'll coordinate there for this.\r\n\r\n# Nice to have\r\n\r\n- [ ] Handle some out-of-band comments from emails (some of these haven't been translated to issues)\r\n\r\n- [x] Discussion of alternative hash_to_base algorithms (#165) --- probably just want a paragraph in Suites talking about how to indicate that a suite uses an alternative hash_to_base (e.g., SHAKE). PR is merged (#175)\r\n\r\n- [x] Style nits (#105) --- might be nice to do a sweep for these, if there's time.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Variable naming nits (#110) --- same as above.\r\n\r\n# Not now\r\n\r\n- [ ] cofactor clearing pseudocode (#166) --- I think this probably goes in the pairings draft, not ours, right?\r\n\r\n- [x] #164 --- only pertains to the repo, not the draft\r\n\r\n- [ ] Decide on removing supersingular maps (#173) - I'd like to talk to some more folks before we make a decision on this. I'm going to be at the ECC Workshop in December---maybe some people there have an opinion.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Flow-chart (#63, #118) - nice to have, but probably doesn't go inside the draft, so we can push this to later.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code clean-up (#98, #112, #151) --- hate to keep kicking this can down the road, but we've got enough on our plates and I doubt there's time. (This also includes test vectors...)\r\n\r\n# Issues that can be closed right now\r\n\r\nI think all of the following can be closed without further action. Please reply if you disagree.\r\n\r\n- [x] #43 - Ristretto will handle this\r\n- [x] #95 - Suites now handle this\r\n- [x] #96 - BLS sigs draft now handles this\r\n- [x] #107 - we now discuss the relevant conversions\r\n- [x] #109 - we decided to do projective in the appendices and affine in the body\r\n- [x] #111 - we decided to do generic straight-line in body text, specific appendix\r\n- [x] #124 - we've decided on a plan here, and it's in the text\r\n- [x] #126 - I think we've got a plan here, too"

In general it's much cheaper to use the technique from WB19, i.e., map to an isogenous curve and then evaluate the isogeny map.

(See section 2 in [RFC 2104](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104).) Since various applications will have `H(msg)` readily computed, it makes sense to use `H(msg)` in `HKDF-Extract` as a \"natural\" way to minimise the chances of hashing `msg` multiple times."

    "body": "There's a potential enhancement/improvement to sgn0 that we might want to consider. This option may have been discussed a little before, but it's probably worth revisiting before things get too ossified.\r\n\r\nThe current version of sgn0 says that an element x in GF(p) is negative just when it is greater than (p - 1) / 2. (Things are slightly more complicated for GF(p^m), but let's ignore that for now.)\r\n\r\nSince p is odd, an alternative means of differentiating between x and -x is via the least significant bit: if the least significant bit of x is set, call x negative, otherwise call it positive. (This works because p - x and x have opposite LSBs, except when x = 0.)\r\n\r\nThe major advantage to this approach is that it's much easier to check a single bit in constant time than it is to compare a value to (p-1)/2. On the other hand, I'd guess that in many cases a constant-time comparison function is already available, so maybe this isn't such a decisive advantage after all.\r\n\r\nThe major disadvantage (if it can be called that) is that it leads to slightly nonintuitive definitions of \"negative.\" For example, normally we'd think of 1 as positive, but by the parity definition, sgn0(1) == -1, and sgn0(p - 1) == 1. But maybe that's OK.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nSince this would be a breaking change, sooner is better than later. Also, it might change the suites definitions, since some suites have a constant Z that is \"smallest in absolute value, breaking ties by choosing the positive one,\" and changing the definition of sign might change that."

Instead, he suggests using [HKDF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869).\r\n\r\n(I have to admit, I'm slightly annoyed at myself for having failed to consider this option. Sorry, folks.)\r\n\r\nWhile this makes hash_to_base slightly more expensive, the difference in cost is negligible compared to the end-to-end cost of hashing to a curve.\r\n\r\nThe main issues I see with taking this approach are:\r\n\r\n- is there a way to get \"prehash for free\" as in the current approach?\r\n- is there a compatibility story for the BLS signatures standard?\r\n\r\n@hoeteck, thoughts on how this might play out with BLS? I can imagine there isn't a huge appetite for this change. On the other hand, I wonder if we can really justify using a hash_to_base function that lacks rigorous analysis when the (arguably) \"right thing\" is kind of well known?"

This is an attempt at triaging the open issues and known TODOs to hit that date.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if anything seems to be miscategorized!\r\n\r\n## Really should have\r\n\r\n- [x] Definitions: maps, encodings, etc. (#127, #128) - making sure that the definitions and high-level framing are clear is important for getting useful feedback on the next draft. Plus, these should be very close to converging!\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix point conversions for Edwards -> Montgomery to agree with existing RFCs (#107) - see second comment in linked issue. VRF won't reference us until this is fixed. #132 handles this.\r\n\r\n- [x] Update list of suites / decide on suite scope (#96, #126) - my hope is that we can take an initial cut at this and then solicit feedback.\r\n\r\n- [x] Cofactor clearing (#95) - @chris-wood and I discussed including \"cofactor clearing value\" in the suites table. For curves that have optimized cofactor clearing (generally, pairing-friendly curves), this is sufficient to make sure that people who don't implement the optimization can still output the correct point via scalar multiplication. Adding a column in the suites table addresses this.\r\n\r\n## Nice to have\r\n\r\n- [ ] Submit PR to VRF folks to refer to this draft rather than describing its own version of hash-to-curve - not sure if we can coordinate this in time, but we should try!\r\n   \r\n   (EDIT: I'm in a conversation with the VRF folks about this. Looks like we won't make it before July 8th, but that's fine---we'll make it happen as we can.)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Projective coordinates / optimized implementations (#4, #43, #109, #111, #117) - once we have an updated list of suites, we should put optimized impls in the appx.\r\n\r\n- [x] Domain separation (#124) - the discussion in the issue seems at this point to have identified the main pros and cons, so it seems like we should open this up for discussion on-list or at the meeting. We might not get this feedback in time, but we should try.\r\n   \r\n   (EDIT: marked this completed because #139 landed. Not sure if that means we can close #124, though.)\r\n\r\n## Not a blocker\r\n\r\n- [ ] Flow chart (#63, #118) - these will be very useful, but (as far as I know) we can't include non-ASCII diagrams in the draft, so it probably doesn't make sense to spend too much time on these before the deadline.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code quality (#98, #112) - reference code isn't gated by the draft process, so we can de-prioritize.\r\n\r\n- [ ] style nits (#105, #110) - would be great to cover these, but not a killer if we don't."

On the other hand, since they're a bit lower level than what's necessary for the purpose of standardizing (implementations of) hashes to curves, and in particular since they're not likely to be of interest to implementors in most cases, it seems like this might be a good candidate for an appendix that briefly summarizes the relevant properties and cites the appropriate primary sources (FFSTV13, for example).\r\n\r\nI think there are some other issues that need to be addressed first, so I'm stashing an issue and we can revisit in the future."

The first commit pulls the fenced code back to the left margin, which fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n- I reworked and streamlined the terminology section. It had been growing organically for a little while and needed some pruning and harmonizing with the terminology in the rest of the document\r\n\r\n- I renamed \"injective encoding\" to \"nonuniform encoding,\" because I realized that the term \"injective\" is not correct: by a simple counting argument, hash2base must produce collisions for some inputs, so composing hash2base with map2curve cannot produce an injective function. **I'm not fixed on \"nonuniform\"**---does anyone have a better suggestion?\r\n\r\n- bibliography cleanup: moved most cites to \"informative\" from \"normative\" bib, added a couple general cites for further reading on elliptic curves, corrected a couple labels, and got rid of redundant entries.\r\n\r\n- Some very small edits in roadmap for clarity."

    "body": "Chris and I discussed the issue of ciphersuites and domain separation in hash-to-curve. Put concisely, the question is, should hash-to-curve provide domain separation among the suites, or should domain separation be left to the upper-level protocol? We decided that the best way to proceed is to get feedback from the CFRG list by coming up with and sending two specific proposals along with a discussion of pros and cons.\r\n\r\nFrom chatting with the BLS and VRF folks, my impression is that they prefer to keep ciphersuites out of hash-to-curve. Their argument is (paraphrasing), the upper-level protocol needs to ensure domain separation, so what's the point of doing it redundantly in hash-to-curve? There was also serious concern about variable-length ciphersuite strings (currently used in the poc impls but not specified in the document), because that is a potential source of confusion and bugs. [Right now](https://github.com/pairingwg/bls_standard/blob/master/minutes/spec-v1.md), the BLS sigs standard is proceeding with no ciphersuite in hash-to-curve, only in the BLS signature itself.\r\n\r\nBut there may be room to meet in the middle. For example, it would be essentially free to add a short, fixed-length ciphersuite (say, <20 bytes) in hash2base. It might be worth running this by the BLS and VRF folks before we go to the list, to hear out the likely objectors first and see if we can get buy-in.\r\n\r\nConcretely, I propose that we consider the following two options.\r\n\r\n#### option 1: no ciphersuite\r\n\r\nThis preserves the current version of hash2base as specified in the document. The important line is the one in which msg gets hashed. In the current version, that's\r\n\r\n```\r\nm' = H(msg) || I2OSP(ctr, 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### option 2: fixed string + 4-byte ciphersuite in hash2base\r\n\r\n```\r\nm' = H(\"HASH-TO-CURVE\" || ciphersuite || msg) || I2OSP(ctr, 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: or, maybe slightly preferable so that \"prehash-for-free\" still works:\r\n\r\n```\r\nm' = \"HASH-TO-CURVE\" || ciphersuite || H(msg) || I2OSP(ctr, 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: I think it's safe to assume that \"ciphersuite\" here would be generated following something like the procedure in [this comment, below](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve/issues/124#issuecomment-507069455). This avoids issues with ciphersuites for curves not discussed in the spec document.\r\n\r\nNote that the string \"HASH-TO-CURVE\" ensures domain separation even from other protocols that use a 4-byte ciphersuite tag. It might be nice for protocols to adopt this approach more genreally.\r\n\r\n(Actually, I kind of like the idea of using the RFC number (e.g., \"RFC1234\" for RFC 1234's domain separation string), but that has the downside that the protocol's test vectors can't be finalized until the RFC number is assigned.)\r\n\r\nThoughts on the above two proposals? Any other issues we should consider?"

    "body": "This updates hash2base to use the same method described in the Pairing WG's BLS signatures [spec-v1](https://github.com/pairingwg/bls_standard/blob/master/minutes/spec-v1.md).\r\n\r\nExecutive summary:\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this change is that it makes it possible to call hash2base multiple times (for the random oracle construction) while hashing the input message exactly once. This avoids requiring applications to specify pre-hashing and also avoids requiring implementors to make non-black-box use of a hash function (e.g., computing a \"partial\" hash of a message and then \"finishing\" the hash in two different ways to get the two different evaluations for the random oracle construction).\r\n\r\nOne potential downside of this change is that it requires adding an argument `ctr` to all of the map2curve functions, which is \"passed through\" to hash2base. (This PR makes that change.) To address this slight ugliness, this PR makes `ctr` optional and defaults it to 0 if not specified. That way, one can still sensibly refer to a value like `map2curve(alpha)`.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nThe reasoning is as follows. In the current hash2base, one might want to call, say,\r\n\r\n    hash2base(msg || I2OSP(1, 1))\r\n    hash2base(msg || I2OSP(2, 1))\r\n\r\nand this results in computing, inside the hash2base calls,\r\n\r\n    m_prime_1 = H(msg || I2OSP(1, 1))\r\n    m_prime_2 = H(msg || I2OSP(2, 1))\r\n\r\nIf `msg` is long, this is inefficient. One way to avoid this is, as I mentioned above, to \"partially evaluate\" H on `msg`. But requiring implementors to make non-black-box use of H is undesirable, because it constrains their implementations (for example, what happens if your crypto library doesn't let you partially evaluate H?).\r\n\r\nThe other way to avoid this is to make applications pre-hash messages. That's fine, but requiring them to do that for efficiency is a little unfriendly, because it means that if they forget to specify pre-hashing in their protocol, they have to change the protocol to fix it.\r\n\r\nThis PR gives a third option: call\r\n\r\n    hash2base(msg, 1)\r\n    hash2base(msg, 2)\r\n\r\nThis results in computing, inside the hash2base calls,\r\n\r\n    m_prime_1 = H(msg) || I2OSP(1, 1)\r\n    m_prime_2 = H(msg) || I2OSP(2, 1)\r\n\r\nSince the concatenation is outside the call to H, both invocations of hash2base can share the same evaluation of `H(msg)`. This allows seamlessly optimizing the implementation of hash2base in a way that is guaranteed to be backward compatible, which means that applications do not have to worry about breaking changes that come as a result of pre-hashing."

This would likely be more useful for implementors, both because they would be able to port these directly (rather than having to understand and adapt the generic procedures) and because it would allow us to roll in more optimizations.\r\n\r\nThe `poc/` directory gives us a good start on the list of curves that should be supported in this way.

    "body": "Most of the maps can be made faster by dealing in projective rather than affine coordinates, since this should suffice to eliminate inversions (maybe with one more trick here and there).\r\n\r\nIf the goal is to suggest nicely optimized implementations everywhere, one possibility is to allow all map definitions to give projective outputs and then separately handle conversion back to affine coordinates.\r\n\r\nMapping to a projective point and then clearing the denominator is just as fast as mapping directly to an affine coordinate. In most cases, it's faster end-to-end: if the higher-level application does further operations on the output of the map, it's safe to assume those operations will be over projective coordinates, in which case converting to affine coordinates first is unnecessary and strictly slower.\r\n\r\nThis probably requires a small discussion (appx? elsewhere?) about projective coordinates, conversions, etc. Happy to take a crack at this."

Please see specific notes on the checkbox items below.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all of your hard work on this standardization effort!\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP pull request that rolls up a bunch of edits addressing a few open issues. I'm sharing now to start getting feedback and to start discussing how to handle some of the remaining open questions.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your feedback! And, of course, I'm happy to split this up into multiple PRs, squash commits, etc. as you prefer.\r\n\r\nThe issues that this PR touches are:\r\n\r\n- [x] #52 - explicitly defined a primitive `inv0` in S3 that returns 0 on input 0. Could require impl via exponentiation as suggested in that issue. ~~**TODO** decide whether to require impl via exponentiation.~~ leave this unresolved in #52\r\n\r\n- [x] #54 - ~~this is WIP.

    "body": "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI think there is no reason to suggest in the standard that implementors use non-\"simplified\" SWU (i.e., the one from Ulas 2007). The non-simplified version is less efficient than simplified one and is no more general (i.e., it doesn't apply to any curves that simplified doesn't).\r\n\r\nNote: the second half of the above claim is maybe not totally obvious, but in [our recent work](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/403) we show a very simple way to extend simplified SWU to curves over fields of any characteristic (not just Fp, p = 3 mod 4)."

I notice in the current draft that the section discussing the work of Fouque and Tibouchi at Latincrypt 2012 does not correctly attribute the work. The FT12 paper is clear that the map the authors describe is an instantiation of the Shallue--van de Woestijne method, with constants selected in a way that is convenient for Barreto-Naehrig curves. So a cite of S--vdW (ANTS 2006) would probably be appropriate here.\r\n\r\n2. ~~It's probably important to point out in this section that the map is undefined when u = 0 and when u = sqrt(-1-B). The first case can happen for any curve. The second case can only happen when (-1-B) is square. For BN curves this will never be true, but for BLS curves is can and likely will be. (As a specific example, -1-B is square for BLS12-381, so the map as described is undefined at +/-sqrt(-5).)~~\r\n\r\n~~In fact, the second comment might be true more generally. A brief search of the document doesn't turn up any instances discussing what to do if/when the map is undefined. This is probably important, since in practice many of these maps will have some undefined inputs, and it would be unfortunate if different implementations diverged in their behavior.~~\r\n\r\n~~Since the document appears to be encouraging constant-time implementations, it's not clear that there's a good blanket recommendation that would apply to every map.

I'm not sure which is correct, but they should be consistent.\r\n\r\nIn the algorithm for SimpleSWU, the overview says that the right factor of alpha is (1+(1/(t^4 **+** t^2))), but the original paper (Prop 7) shows (1+(1/(t^4 **-** t^2))). The problem is only in the overview; the algorithm details look correct because step 3 negates alpha.\r\n"

    "body": "I think the way we specify the FFSTV (and potentially all the algorithms) is a bit clunky (at best) or ambiguous.\r\n\r\nIf we look at https://github.com/chris-wood/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve/blob/master/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve.md#general-construction-ffstv13-ffstv\r\n\r\n```\r\n~~~\r\nhash2curve(alpha) = F(H0(alpha)) + F(H1(alpha))\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThis construction works for the Icart, SWU, and Simplfied SWU encodings.\r\n\r\nHere, H0 and H1 are constructed as follows:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nH0(alpha) = HashToBase(alpha || 0x2)\r\nH1(alpha) = HashToBase(alpha || 0x3)\r\n~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust to check we are in agreement with what this is/should be doing. As it is written, you will hash alpha (with 0x02 or 0x03), pass the result to F. Which generally speaking will compute another hash. \r\n\r\nI.e. in Icart, you would effectively have `u = HashToBase(HashToBase(alpha || 0x02))` when computing the first of those? Which is a bit confusing since HashToBase outputs an element in Fp.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, would we consider rewriting the algorithms to all be `Fp -> E`... Which saves the redundant hashing for some algorithms, but is messy since SWU actually needs `(Fp x Fp) -> E`.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just checking that the above is a correct reading."

Declare explicitly how to compute the `sqrt` function for each case. Although that for `p=3 mod 4` is easy, the remainder cases are not easy to state.\r\n\r\n2. Declare explicitly which root to choose. Relying on math, the document can state, for example, that the valid root to use is the one that is odd (or even). It is known that either `r0` or `r1` will be odd. This allows the implementer to use the best-known algorithm for computing `sqrt` as soon as the root returned by it be the one that is odd (or even).\r\n\r\nI believe that Option 2 is suitable and more flexible. \r\nHappy to hear your comments about it.\r\n\r\n"

If they are simply ignored (e.g., `\"abc\" || empty_bytestring == \"abc\"`), then there are potential collisions in HashToBase.\r\n\r\nLet's focus on the input of the hash function during the first step of HashToBase:\r\n`H(\"h2c\" || label || I2OSP(i, 4) || x)`\r\n\r\nAssume that `I2OSP(i, 4)` has some specific value (e.g., '00000000', which is the default). The hash `H(\"h2c\" || 00000000 || 00000000)` corresponds to two different configurations:\r\n\r\n- `label = 00000000` and `x` is empty\r\n- `label` is empty and `x = 00000000`\r\n\r\nA possible solution is to prepend the length of `label` and `x` to both values."

It doesn't make sense.\r\nAccording to the comment (and code) at the end of step 16, `t1 = (2p - 1)/3`, however in step 17 you raise _x_ (with a current value of `v^2 - b - u^6/27` from step 14) to the power of _t1_ and claim the result is `(v^2 - b - u^6/27) ^ (1/3)`.  Unless I'm missing something in the math, you actually get `(v^2 - b - u^6/27) ^ ((2p - 1)/3)`.\r\n\r\n> Thinking about it, step 15 doesn't really make sense anyway. As the whole thing is `mod p`, isn't that step just equivalent to `t1 = -1 mod p`? I'm clearly missing something.\r\n\r\nStep 15 is in the group of exponents, i.e. `mod (p-1)`. Which is what gives the equivalence required (2p-1)/3 = 1/3 `mod (p-1)`.\r\n"

Section 2 states that n = qh + r, where n is order of the group of elliptic curve points, q is a prime order of a subgroup of the group of elliptic curve points, h is a cofactor and r is a remainder. Is there any sense to use value r? Every nonzero r directly violates Lagrange's theorem.\r\n\r\n2. In the sixth paragraph of Section 2 states that n can be estimated using Hasse's theorem as |n-p| < 2 * sqrt(p). This is true for the prime field case, otherwise we have to use Hasse-Weil theorem.\r\n\r\n3. The same paragraph refers that if point (x, y) belongs to some curve, then (x, -y) also does. It must be stated explicitly, that it is true for certain curve forms – because this is not true for some coordinate forms like twisted Edwards.\r\n\r\n4. The second paragraph of Section 2.1.1 states that \"In most cases, the curve E is over a finite field GF(p^k), with p > 2.\". Are you sure about it? The vast majority of standardized curves defined over extension fields seems to have p = 2.\r\n\r\n5. Some clarifications about two separate HashToBase implementations should be added into Section 5.2.2.\r\n\r\n6. Section 5.2.2, paragraph 6. Add word <<short>> before <<Weierstrass form>>.\r\n\r\n7. Section 5.2.4. Description of Elligator2 method uses f(x) function and returns its value instead of a pair of coordinates.\r\n\r\n8. Appendix B, paragraph 1. “Section Section”.\r\n\r\n9. Appendix B, algorithm description, step 4E. Does symbol ^ stay here for scalar point multiplication?\r\n\r\n10. I believe that the HashToBase function has to be described as explicitly as it is possible (including byte order, possible hash function sets for different curves) (the same issue with “be as explicit as possible” applies to our “Randomness improvements …” draft also J\r\n\r\n11. Appendix A.5. “&#8746” instead of cup symbol?\r\n\r\n12. Misprints: “artbirary”, “simplified”."

The uses of CMOV later in the draft rely on this. However, it is more complicated to implement a time-invariant CMOV for such a case. In fact, OpenSSL's CMOV assumes 0 or 1 (see https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/7d38ca3f8bca58bf7b69e78c1f1ab69e5f429dff/crypto/ec/curve25519.c#L1475), and thus the more general CMOV may be unavailable to a developer. Moreover, a developer may not realize that the CMOV available in code is not the same as the more powerful CMOV called for in the draft, because the name is the same."

But I thought it was important to get it down. I would be happy to push the theoretical parts to later/the appendix.\r\n\r\nWith this in place, Chapter 3 could be even more informative. For example:\r\n\r\nUse case: Encoding bitstring to curve point (for use as group generator):\r\n`m -> H(m) * G`\r\n\r\nUse case: Hashing to curve point (for use in CDH/DDH-like protocol):\r\n`m -> F(H(m))`, given additional proof and for F in {Icart, SWU, etc} by parameters.\r\n (This is the existing table, maybe add some info for supersingular and x-only scalar mult).\r\n\r\nUse case: Hashing to curve point (default, all, gives random oracle):\r\n`m -> F(H1(m)) + F(H2(m))` for F in {...} \r\n\r\nand so on. So then this becomes a useful lookup from application to function.\r\n\r\nI'll keep writing some stuff for review, but happy to take any comments in the meantime.\r\n"

Although this only happens with probability 2^-32, perhaps it should be an explicit condition for the loop.

However, I think it would be better if this is defined as a method supporting variable length outputs.  For example, HKDF (Hmac Key Derivation Function).  The justification being that some elliptic curves operate on fields that are too large, even for SHA-512 (e.g. NIST P-521), and naive attempts at extending the length of a hash may otherwise be designed insecurely.\r\n\r\nIf the function is specified as HKDF (which operates on bytes rather than bits) there should be clarification as to which bits of the output are to be used (e.g. the left-most bits output by HKDF)."
